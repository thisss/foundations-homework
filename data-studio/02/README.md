# Homework 2

Class: Data Studio

Mathias Born

For this assignment, I was working with data from the Federal Office for Statistics about overnight stay of tourists in my region. It can be downloaded [from here](https://www.pxweb.bfs.admin.ch/default.aspx?px_language=de). I was working on this dataset a couple of weeks ago. Now knowing about timeseries, the work would probably be much easier. 

Nevertheless, I did face a lot of challenges. I did try to put two datasets on the same plot. That was quite challenging -- and didn't look good. Finally, I got two graphs to work on in Inkscape. 

You will find the process of working on the data in the Jupyter Notebook. The final results are "europroblem_bearbeitet.svg" and "bestguest.svg". 

### Six questions

- From what country of origin are most of the guests in Bern's hotels coming?
- How did the number of overnight stays develop in the last 10 years? 
- What time of the year are the Germans visiting?
- In what month of what year took the maximum of tourists an overnight stop in Bern?
- How many people are normally sleeping in Bern's hotels -- in winter, spring, summer and fall?
- What was the worst month in the recent history of Bern's hotels?

### Three possible headlines

- We should embrace the Germans!
- The hotels are badly relying on German speaking guests
- The weak Euro causes troubles for tourism
