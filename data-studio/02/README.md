# Homework 2
Class: Data Studio
Mathias Born

For this assignment, I was working with data from the Federal Office for Statistics about overnight stay of tourists in my region. I was working on this dataset a couple of weeks ago. Now knowing about timeseries, the work would probably be much easier. 

Nevertheless, I did face a lot of challenges. I did try to put two datasets on the same plot. That was quite challenging -- and didn't look good. Finally, I got two graphs to work on in Inkscape. 

You will find the process of working on the data in the Jupyter Notebook. The final results are "europroblem_bearbeitet.svg" and "bestguest.svg".
