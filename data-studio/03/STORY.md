# Map the Fans

Is it true that football is an urban thing while ice hockey is the country bumpkin's game?

I recently received a two datasets containing all the ZIP codes of the holder of a season card at Bern's biggest sport clubs "YB" (football) and "SCB" (ice hockey). I will analyze this data and put it on a map. 

## Possible stories

A collegue of mine will then write some articles about the holder of the season cards.

- Portrait of a fan that spends his money for football and ice hockey.
