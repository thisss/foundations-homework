# Homework 8
In this assignement I tried to discover two data sets that might be interesting in my daily work: one is about the tourism industry and one about animal's deseases. In both cases I focused on the area our newspaper is mainly covering: the canton of Bern in Switzerland. The work with the two datasets proved to be very different. 

[Sleeping tourists:](https://github.com/thisss/lede12-homework/blob/master/foundations/08/homework_08.ipynb) The data about tourists was not appropriate structured to be used with pandas. Whatever I tried, it didn't work out. I finally spent a lot of time analyzing the data outsinde of pandas. The conclusion: Sometimes it would be more productive to first clear the dataset before starting to work with it. 

[Sick animals:](https://github.com/thisss/lede12-homework/blob/master/foundations/08/homework_08_02.ipynb) I didn't have this kind of problems with the second dataset about diseases of animals. The work with pandas was straight forward. I faced problems working with the dates, though: They are in the local format and Pandas doesn't seem to recognize it. How would you proceed in this case? Using regular expressions to alter the format? Or could we maybe help Pandas to understand these fields using "time" or "datetime"? I finally tried it -- with a little help from a TA -- with the dateutil module and a lambda function.
