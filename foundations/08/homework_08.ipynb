    "Switzerland's national department of statistics publishes some [data about tourism](https://www.pxweb.bfs.admin.ch/default.aspx?px_language=de). I would like to look at the information about the overnight stays in in and around of the city of Bern. \n",

    "I first downloaded [a first dataset](https://www.pxweb.bfs.admin.ch/DownloadFile.aspx?file=px-x-1003020000_103). It was too complicated to work with, though, since there are too many dimensions. Therefor I went back and got a simpler version not containing detail information about the exact region and just listening the the nights (without the arrivals). Later I had to go back again: I couldn't sum the values easily since the values were not in a row but in a line. And I first had to exclude the rows with the year and the month. I finally got the final version of the raw data. \n",
